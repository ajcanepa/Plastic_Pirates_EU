Tim Kiesling is OUT of Bussiness from Plastic Pirates

## Workshop - General Assembly
Three parts.
--> Review the dataset (Janto, replacing to Tim Kieseling)
--> Data Management (Charlotte)
--> Data Analysis (our part)

## Review the dataset (Janto)
Why is so complicated the validation process?
Mechanism thought to be precise and useful, but not simple.
Maybe an improvement?

## Data Analysis
Defend the percentage of validation for each group. --> Charlotte has the raw dataset upon request.
Differences in validation criteria (first year was more strict) --> Pick up some algorithm
Work from Tim Kiesling with an algorithm?
An example from Observation.org
https://observation.org/pages/validator-manual/

Analysis based on Socio/Ecology questions, that can be answered through groups data.
