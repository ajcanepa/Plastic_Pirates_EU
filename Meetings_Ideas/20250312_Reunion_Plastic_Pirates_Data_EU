# 20250312_Reunion_Plastic_Pirates_Data_EU

Start the point were we left.

We had few research questions (see the previous notes)

What about Github?
The data published is on github in addition with the code for data "accomodation"

The data isn't updated (few things are neccesary yet) in github.

There is one version with all the countries collided (there are more than two versions). 


Our work is to create lines or to lead the publication process? We lead!

The data from Zenodo can be an option, but it still in the data verification format. 
We will start with these datasets at the beggininng until we found something weird. In that case we touch Charlotte with comments ideas.

Data will be ready for Abril 2024
Will include data for Autummn 2024 but not for all the countries.

I suggest a general in macro-plastics with some reseacrh questions (general and also related with people engagement)

Later in a second approach we can try the most advanced stuff including both Macro- and Micro-Plastic.

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS

# Citizens Description?

# Litter Presence/Absence

# Community-based approach to analyze composition of litter

# Look for explanatory variables inside the dataset from Plastic Pirates.

# Include extra-explanatory variables for all the variables will be nice if something else can take care on this.

# Next meeting before the Workshop on Data Validation/Consolidation and Analysis.
