## Today's catch-up on the analysis 


# Descriptive Stats - Sampling
# There will be a data paper, Do not overlap! --> Data Collection and Num. Scholls, Num. Participants, etc.

## Number of regions involved in the Plastic Pirates sampling. 
## Number of young people involved. 
## Number of river samplings conducted, both overall and by campaign. Age of participants.


# Descriptive Stats - Results

## The approach will be easiest to explain analysing for each group. --> This is the approach for the analysis, but not for the way to present the data.

## the general ecological question for the second approach/paper.

## Group A is better suited for comparison with environmental/hydromorfological variables.
## Group B is better suited for comparison with human variables, like the presence of parks, cities, factories.

## Environmentally
# We can look for MeteoStat for a time-lag to look for MeteoStat data.
# We can / have to use the data that has colledted by students "Group D". (like the "potential soure of Litter") for the studnet's perceptiom

# Group C?
## It's worthly to show that children can detect microplastrics in European rivers
## Agree with Patricia's  comments on group C. --> floating waste is OK (Item numbers).


## Seasonality

### Only using Spring v/s Autumn campaigns --> Check preliminary on this. 
From a general point of view (the most five more importants plastic on so on).
